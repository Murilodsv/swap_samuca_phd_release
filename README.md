## Users:

- Download this repository
- Setup simulations in Swap.swp file
- To run SAMUCA, CROPNAME, CROPFIL and CROPTYPE of Swap.swp file must be:
- CROPNAME = 'Sugarcane'
- CROPFIL  = 'Sugarcane'
- CROPTYPE = 4
- Make sure sugarcane crop paramaters are in the file "Param_SAMUCA.par" and placed in the same folder.
- Place anyother needed file from Swap.swp at same folder (weather, irrigation, soil temperature, etc...)
- Double click on SWAP_SAMUCA.exe
- Simulation results are in 'Plant_%prj.name%.OUT'
